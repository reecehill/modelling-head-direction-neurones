1) Interface (Python): this is intended as a proof-of-concept piece, to produce realtime graphs of cell activity as the head is turned. by Reece.
2) Parrivesh (Matlab): work produced by Parrivesh (31/03/22), stored here for reference.
3) Simulation (Python): coded to implement and explore the findings of K. Zhang in Python (https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.16-06-02112.1996)
